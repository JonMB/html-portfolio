 <h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2><br>
 <hr>
  <h3>The Godfather</h3>
 <p>The Godfather is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the crime genre, delivering a gripping tale of power,
     loyalty, and family. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, the film is a triumph of storytelling, characterized by its 
     complex characters and a meticulously crafted plot that explores the dark underbelly of the American Dream. Marlon Brando's
      iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone is both commanding and deeply human, while Al Pacino's transformation from the reluctant
       Michael to a ruthless mafia leader is nothing short of mesmerizing. The Godfather's haunting score, unforgettable dialogue, 
       and powerful performances make it a timeless classic,
     cementing its place as one of the greatest films in cinematic history.</p>
     <h3>The Deer Hunter</h3>
     <p>The Deer Hunter is a haunting and powerful exploration of the effects of war on the human soul,
         masterfully directed by Michael Cimino. The film delves deep into the lives of three working-class friends 
         from a Pennsylvania steel town, whose bonds are tested and forever altered by the horrors of the Vietnam War.
          With its unflinching portrayal of the brutalities of combat and the psychological scars that linger long after the 
          battle is over, The Deer Hunter is both epic and intimate. Robert De Niro delivers a stunning performance as Michael, 
          the stoic leader of the group, while Christopher Walken's portrayal of the shattered Nick is heartbreaking and unforgettable. 
          The film's intense Russian roulette scenes and its exploration of loss, trauma, and friendship create a profoundly 
          emotional and thought-provoking experience, securing its place as a landmark in American cinema. </p>
          <h3>Alien</h3>
          <p>Alien is a masterclass in science fiction horror, directed by Ridley Scott, 
            that redefined the genre with its claustrophobic atmosphere and groundbreaking visual design.
             Set aboard the commercial spaceship Nostromo, the film follows the crew as they encounter a 
             terrifying extraterrestrial life form that begins to pick them off one by one. Sigourney Weaver's 
             portrayal of Ripley, a strong and resourceful heroine, set a new standard for female protagonists in action films. 
             The creature design by H.R. Giger, with its unsettling blend of the organic and the mechanical, remains
              one of the most iconic and terrifying in cinematic history. With its slow-burn tension, eerie score, 
              and shocking moments of terror, Alien is a gripping and suspenseful experience that continues to influence
             and inspire the genre decades after its release.</p>
